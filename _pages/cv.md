## Education

**B.S. in Computer Science** -- Capital University of Science and Technology (CUST), Islamabad, Pakistan (2019 -- 2023)
- CGPA: 3.08 / 4.00
- Relevant coursework: Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, Databases, Operating Systems, Distributed Systems

## Experience

**Forward Deployed Machine Learning Engineer** -- Kodamai, Remote (United Kingdom) *(Nov 2025 -- Present)*
- Investigated and improved RAG pipelines for multilingual (Arabic-English) document understanding, emphasizing retrieval quality and inference efficiency
- Designed document ingestion workflows for text-based and scanned PDFs, integrating PaddleOCR (PP-OCRv5) with multilingual preprocessing
- Studied layout-aware parsing using Docling combined with vision-language model approaches to reduce OCR-only dependency
- Analyzed system-level bottlenecks across ingestion, vector search, and inference pipelines for on-prem GPU-constrained deployments

**Lead Data Scientist** -- Exora AI, Remote (Singapore) *(Jul 2024 -- Nov 2025)*
- Led the design of a healthcare-focused generative AI platform, reducing latency and cost via context caching, token optimization, and selective model offloading
- Built and evaluated production-grade RAG and triage pipelines used in real clinical workflows with safety-aware prompting
- Developed multimodal AI capabilities using vision-language embeddings (SigLIP, BLIP) for visual diagnosis and multi-stage consultations
- Designed PHI-compliant observability infrastructure with structured logging, latency tracing, and automated PII/PHI redaction

**Senior Machine Learning Engineer** -- The Quell App, Remote (Canada) *(Jan 2024 -- May 2024)*
- Developed a Dockerized generative-AI MVP combining conversational agents with personalized behavioral routines
- Evaluated open-source LLMs and deployed Mistral-7B in a self-hosted inference setup with safety enforcement
- Conducted structured A/B evaluations of prompt strategies to improve conversational reliability

**Machine Learning Engineer** -- DiveDeepAI, Islamabad, Pakistan *(Apr 2023 -- Jan 2024)*
- Designed and deployed an end-to-end e-commerce analytics pipeline using large-scale web scraping and automated preprocessing
- Built ML models for price recommendation using demand, competitor, and product-attribute signals
- Deployed ML services using FastAPI, Redis, Celery, and AWS with emphasis on reliability and model versioning

## Open-Source Contributions

**Google / Flax (JAX Ecosystem)** -- Top Contributor (last 12 months)
- Contributed to NNX transforms, variable management, model tabulation stability, and documentation
- Focused on correctness, numerical stability, and maintainability in large-scale ML frameworks

**CPython** -- Contributor
