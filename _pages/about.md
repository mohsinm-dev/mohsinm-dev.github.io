I'm a Machine Learning Engineer focused on building production-grade AI systems, with deep experience in retrieval-augmented generation, multilingual NLP, and healthcare AI. Currently at [Kodamai](https://kodamai.com/) (UK), I work on multilingual RAG pipelines for Arabic-English document understanding.

My research interests span applied AI, AI-driven software engineering, intelligent health and decision-support systems, and the evaluation and reliability of machine learning systems in production.

I'm an active open-source contributor -- a top contributor to [Google/Flax](https://github.com/google/flax) (JAX ecosystem), and have contributed to [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython), [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), [CausalML](https://github.com/uber/causalml), and [Astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy).
