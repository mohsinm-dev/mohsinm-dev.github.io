I'm a Machine Learning Engineer who builds reliable AI systems that work in the real world. My work sits at the intersection of applied machine learning, software engineering, and infrastructure -- taking models from research to production at scale.

I specialize in language understanding, retrieval-augmented generation, and multimodal AI, with particular depth in healthcare and multilingual domains. I care about the parts most people skip: evaluation rigor, system reliability, latency budgets, and making sure things actually work when users depend on them.

I'm also a committed open-source contributor. I'm a top contributor to [Google/Flax](https://github.com/google/flax) in the JAX ecosystem, and have made contributions to [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython), [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), [CausalML](https://github.com/uber/causalml), and [Astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy). I believe working on foundational tools is one of the highest-leverage things an engineer can do.

Previously, I've led AI teams across healthcare, consumer, and e-commerce -- shipping production systems from Singapore, Canada, the UK, and Pakistan.
