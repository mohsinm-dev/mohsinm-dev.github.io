Hi, I'm Mohsin and I am a machine learning enthusiast currently working as a deep learning intern at Horizon Tech Pvt. Ltd. As an applied A.I researcher, I am particularly interested in the basic research and real-world applications of deep learning and computer vision.

One area that I am particularly passionate about is computer vision. Computer vision is the field of artificial intelligence that deals with the development of algorithms and techniques that enable machines to interpret and understand visual information, such as images and videos. This field has a wide range of applications, including self-driving cars, facial recognition, image search, and many more.

I have had several internships in the field of computer vision and machine learning, and I have gained a lot of experience in this area. I have worked on projects that involve image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. I have also worked on the development of deep learning models that are used for image recognition and object detection.
